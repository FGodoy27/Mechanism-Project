## project Delivery of Mechanisms
For this project, the solution to a real-life problem was proposed using three-position mechanism synthesis. The input requirements and constraints were defined, and a graphic synthesis was performed to build an animated CAD or real model of the mechanism demonstrating the functionality of the solution.
## Mechanism Selected for the Project
We chose the crude oil extractor as our mechanism. Below, we show its components and design.
